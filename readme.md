Music Videos in R
====
The two examples are at

* https://github.com/csvsoundsystem/fms-treasury-statements-analysis.git
* http://gitorious.org/tlevine/12daysplot.git

Generate the slides by running `Rscript slides.r`. This loads the
`slides.Rmd` template, knits it, converts it to HTML and puts the output
in `index.html`. All of the webby files in this directory allow that
file to be a slideshow.
