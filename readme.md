Music Videos in R
====
The two examples are at

* https://github.com/csvsoundsystem/fms-treasury-statements-analysis.git
* http://gitorious.org/tlevine/12daysplot.git

Generate the slides by running `Rscript slides.r`. This loads the
`slides.Rmd` template, knits it, converts it to HTML and puts the output
in `index.html`. All of the webby files in this directory allow that
file to be a slideshow.

## Things to remember to talk about

* Point out that creating pretty graphs in base R graphics is quite unpleasant;
    this is why you should ordinarily use ggplot2.
* If symph.io were a real company, we'd note that we're hiring. But we're not a
    real company, so we instead note that we're available for hire.

## OUTLINE:

### Small talk
I'm Thomas - Data Superhero
I'm Brian - Data Scientologist

### Intro (Trade Off) - 5 minutes
    * big data is complex
    * visuals cannot fully capture the dimensionality of big data
    * we need new sensory experiences to express more dimensions
    * obama video - what do kids like? dubsteb and big data
    * we need poppy big data music videos
    * we've built these ideas are into symph.io
        - we have a proprietary data experience engine that
        big data companies are using them tame their big data tsunamis in real time.
        - but we're just gonna talk about some early prototypes we built in R and are now open-sourcing.
